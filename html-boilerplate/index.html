    <h1>Practice Web Page</h1>
    <p>
        This is just some <b><em>really dumb</em></b> paragraph of text that 
        I'm writing so that I can have some content on here with which to 
        mess around with as I'm following the rest of the assignment.
    </p>
    <p>
        I know how to setup <b>CSS</b> and <b>HTML</b> sheets already (for the
        most part at least). This is just a way to practice further. :)
